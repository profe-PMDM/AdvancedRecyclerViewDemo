# AdvancedRecyclerViewDemo
**Sample Code for Lesson 10 RecyclerView (2022/2023)**

This repo is a sample code shown in classroom to study RecyclerView within Android Development.
It corresponds to Lesson 10 "Advanced RecyclerView use cases" of the module "Multimedia and Mobile Devices Programming".
We've developed an app that lists integer numbers from 0 to 100 (and its correspondent binaries).

In the first commit, we've developed the solution using a basic RecyclerView with its adapater (seen in Lesson 5). 

In the second commit, we've replaced adapter with ListAdapter to optimize performance.

In the third commit, we've added Data Binding to handle UI.

In the fourth commit, we've added Binding Adapter to generate and display binary correspondence of integer numbers.

In the fifth commit, we've replaced LinearLayoutManager with GridLayoutManager.

In the sixth commit, we've added clickListeners to items to toast its value.
